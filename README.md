# CRUD application with Angular Signals V16

This app is a basic contacts app showing CRUD operations using the Angular Signals implementation - which has just been released in v16. Services are used to add artificial delay to mimic an API call - will be updating this to showcase more of signals and what they bring to the table with Angular.

Cheers :)
